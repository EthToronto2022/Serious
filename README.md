## Introduction

Marketing or getting the product to your users or finding your users is a key requirement of any project. Almost all products/services will need the help of social media to reach out to a larger set of probable customers. 
The problem as a product builder/ company you are wasting a ton of money to get a 3.4 percent customer conversion rate. In the end your ads are being viewed or dismissed by people who really have no requirement of your product/service.
From the user perspective he is bombarded with ads and phone calls he has no use of. 
The only person who is guaranteed to make money in this process is the middleman social media platform which gets paid for such a low success rate. 
The total amount spent a year in advertising in US is 155 Billion Dollars. That could potentially be savings for the company that can be passed on to the user in discounts on the product.
Women are the major purchasing decision makers and they get targeted by advertisers. Their time should not be wasted on unnecessary ads.

## The Gap

Companies pay a ton of money for wasteful advertisements
Users are bombarded with nonsensical calls and ads
Platforms who provide very little value now makes a bigger because they enjoy network effects

## How Web3 and Smart Contracts can Disrupt this market/ing (Logic Model)

The key is to get SERIOUS buyers to register interest in a product or service. 
Once they have registered interest, they need to commit to open at least one advertiser quote go through the video or fill a form.  And put crypto collateral in an escrow.

Once this is done, advertisers who are listening to this topic are notified and they send their quotes. The user who can see this in their dashboard goes through the offer. The seller can decide to spend his cost of customer acquisition as discount directly to the customer.

## Obstacles
It is a major behavioral change to go and register yourself for an advertisement. This is crucial. You are used to advertisements coming to you online or on TV.

This can only be fixed by viral growth and onboarding great deals from major companies in the beginning. 

## Sustaining the Project
As users review advertisers, advertisers pay a small amount of money from their user acquisition cost average to pay for gas of state update of the smart contract and also for the dev team. 

As the user base and interactions and transactions grow, we will get a better review of the company and their deals as far as customers go. When customers grow so will the companies and the deals they offer.
